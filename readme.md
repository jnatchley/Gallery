 ## Jessica Atchley's Front End Development Website Project
### This website is meant to be a gallery website to display artwork in the future

Features included in this project according to the requirements:

1. A navigation menu that collapses into a responsive mobile-friendly menu (such as a "Hamburger" menu)

2. Use Flexbox or CSS Grid to rearrange 2 or more content areas on your page as the screen changes sizes

3. Create a form that takes in at least two fields of information and validates input (for example, it checks to ensure email is the a@b.com format)

4. Create an image carousel with at least 3 images that it rotates through
