 ## Jessica Atchley's Front End Development Website Project
### This website is meant to be a gallery website to display artwork in the future

Features included in this project according to the requirements:

1. A navigation menu that collapses into a responsive mobile-friendly menu (such as a "Hamburger" menu)

--> Navigation menu at the top that collapses as the screen gets smaller.

2. Use Flexbox or CSS Grid to rearrange 2 or more content areas on your page as the screen changes sizes

--> Columns stack on top one another, as well as the footer.

3. Use Media queries to switch from a one-column mobile layout to a two or more column desktop layout

--> at breakpoint, columns stack on one another to form one column

4. Create a form that takes in at least two fields of information and validates input (for example, it checks to ensure email is the a@b.com format)

--> Newsletter form takes in Name, which is a required field, and an email address, which is also a required field. The email address section requires basic email formatting of an a@b. 

5. Create a JavaScript function whose return value is used in your site. The function must be triggered by user action (ex. clicking a button)

--> Function to tally the number of clicks that a user has on the website button. 

6. Create an image carousel with at least 3 images that it rotates through
